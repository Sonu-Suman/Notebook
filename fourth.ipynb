    "Year y = 2016 is a leap year, so February has 29 days but all the other months have the same number of days as in 2017. When we sum the total number of days in the first eight months, we get 31 + 29 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 = 244. Day of the Programmer is the 256th day, so then calculate 256 - 244 = 12 to determine that it falls on day 12 of the 9th month (September). We then print the full date in the specified format, which is 12.09.2016.\n",
